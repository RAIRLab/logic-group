## Upcoming Talk

Title: Proof Techniques in Modal Logic II

Speaker: Dr. Thomas Ferguson

Date: Wednesday, March 20th at 2PM

Location: RAIR Lab, Winslow (Text Brandon or James for access)

Abstract: This is the first of three talks in which we will review some of the more interesting model-theoretic proof techniques in modal Logic, namely, showing completeness via the technique of canonical models and decidability through the method of filtrations.

In the prior talk, we discussed a family of normal modal logics. In this talk we will emphasize the problem of proving completeness between a normal modal logic and a characteristic class of models. This problem involves showing that if some formula is not provable, then we can find a model in which it is false. The technique of canonical models is a beautiful way of doing this by taking theories---deductively closed sets of sentences---as possible worlds and relating those theories semantically to one another. This process determines a term model based on proof-theoretic notions in which provability in a theory corresponds to truth in a world. We will describe this process and go through several examples.
