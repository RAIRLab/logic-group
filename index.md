Title: Outlines of Logical Externalism

Speaker: Jitka Kadlecikova

Date: Wednesday, March 27th at 2PM

Location: RAIR Lab, Winslow (Text Brandon or James for access)

Abstract: In this talk, I will present and discuss a draft of my paper, "Outlines of Logical Externalism." It is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of inference and reasoning, informed by recent developments in the theory of topic. I will suggest a synthesis of two radical philosophical positions, Putnam (et al.)'s semantic externalism and inferentialism. I argue that when applied to the domain of formal logic, the synthesis of these theories provides a revealing analysis of the way our reasoning is shaped. I will further attempt to reformulate the resulting theory, which I call logical externalism, in terms of topic-theoretic considerations, and present some notions, notably Ferguson's idea of "monstrous content," as real-life applications of this topic-theoretic logical externalism (TT-LE). Finally, I will provide a possible refinement of this theory in order for it to fully conform to TT-LE.
