Title: Syntactic AC Unification

Speaker: Brandon Rozek

Abstract: In proof search, type checking, and cyber-security, algorithms need to find a substitution to equate a set of objects. Over time, unification theory has yielded various algorithms to find these substitutions depending on the background theory of the problem. One well studied theory is equality under associativity-commutativity (AC). Current techniques convert the problem into a Diophantine one, but what if we can solve the problem directly instead? This talk will showcase a preliminary algorithm to directly solve the AC Unification problem. We will discuss the basics of unification theory, prior attempts at combating termination, and the CryptoSolvers toolkit for easy prototyping of Unification algorithms.

## About Us

The NY Capital Region Logic group is a weekly gathering at RPI of people in the NY Capital Region interested in the field of logic and related areas such as
* computational logic
* philosophical logic
* logic based ethics
* automated theorem proving
* interactive theorem proving
* automated planning
* logic based artificial intelligence
