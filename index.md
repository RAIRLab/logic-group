Title: On Forward Closure and the Finite Variant Property

Speaker: Dr. Kimberly Cornell

Abstract: In this talk, we delve into equational unification, an area with wide-ranging applications, such as symbolic cryptographic protocol analysis, automated reasoning and automated theorem provers. Unification modulo a convergent term rewrite system proves to be undecidable, even with just a single rule. To navigate this complexity and pinpoint decidable (and tractable) scenarios, two paradigms have emerged: Basic Syntactic Mutation and the Finite Variant Property.

Drawing inspiration from the Basic Syntactic Mutation approach, our investigation focuses on the notion of forward closure, combined with redundancy constraints. Our results showed that the having a finite forward closure (with redundancy constraints) is equivalent to having the finite variant property for a convergent term rewriting system. We also establish that the decidability of the finiteness of forward closure is undecidable as well as the finite variant property.

## About Us

The NY Capital Region Logic group is a weekly gathering at RPI of people in the NY Capital Region interested in the field of logic and related areas such as
* computational logic
* philosophical logic
* logic based ethics
* automated theorem proving
* interactive theorem proving
* automated planning
* logic based artificial intelligence
