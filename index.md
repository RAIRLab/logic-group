## Upcoming Talk

Title: Quantification in Non-Axiomatic Logic

Time: Wednesday September 27th @ 2PM

Location: RAIR Lab, Winslow

Speaker: James Oswald

Abstract: Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL) is a fuzzy, non-monotonic, and syllogistic logic used by Pei-Wang's cognitive architecture, the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS). This talk will (1) explore the syntactic and semantic foundations of NAL using inheritance logic (IL) and experience grounded semantics, (2) discuss how NAL is extended to handle quantification using variable terms and how this differs from quantification in first order logic, (3) look at how quantification in NAL can represent the four classical aristotelian quantifiers (A, E, I, O)
