## Upcoming Talk

Title: Topic-Theoretic Intensional Logics and Their Rivals (Part 2)

Time: Wednesday September 20th @ 2PM

Location: RAIR Lab, Winslow

Speaker: Dr. Thomas Ferguson

Abstract: Treating topic or subject-matter as a semantically—and
therefore logically—relevant feature of language has recently seen a
sudden resurgence in interest. Appeals to models of topic, e.g., make
for compelling mechanisms to make hyperintensional distinctions between
sentences, which allows for subtler models of epistemic logics, logics
of imagination or logics making distinctions between analytic/synthetic
truth. Across a series of recent papers, I have argued that such models
need to have the flexibility to model intensional subject-matter, i.e.,
the subject matter of sentences including intensional operators. These
papers have also iteratively presented refinements to the core model of
topic. In this talk, I will review some of the historical development of
such logics and their contemporary uses; I will also discuss some of the
considerations that I have leveraged in order to motivate refinements to
the semantic models currently on the market.
